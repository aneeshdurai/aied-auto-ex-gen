## Abstract
Instructors and course staff at large public universities constantly
face a significant challenge when creating problems which assess
student knowledge: allocating the resources to do so. The question
generation process is very involved, requiring concept identifi-
cation, question authoring, and validating the solvability of the
generated problem. In this work, we present a self-healing pipeline
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate exer-
cise variants when given a CS1 courseâ€™s exercises as input. These
variants, specifically item isomorphs, are verifiably correct and ped-
agogically sound. Our approach incorporates an iterative feedback
mechanism that is able to identify and correct errors made by the
LLM, ensuring the reliability of the generated problems.
