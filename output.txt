Implement the function `pack-in-threes`, which takes a list `t` as input. The function returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains at most three elements from `t`, maintaining the order of elements. The final sublist can contain fewer than three elements if necessary.\n\nExample:\n```scheme\nscm> (pack-in-threes '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))\n((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7))\nscm> (pack-in-threes '(1 2 3 4 5))\n((1 2 3) (4 5))\n```\n\n```scheme\n(define (pack-in-threes t)\n  (if (null? t)\n      '()\n      (cons (take 3 t) (pack-in-threes (drop 3 t)))))\n\n(define (take n lst)\n  (if (or (zero? n) (null? lst))\n      '()\n      (cons (car lst) (take (- n 1) (cdr lst)))))\n\n(define (drop n lst)\n  (if (or (zero? n) (null? lst))\n      lst\n      (drop (- n 1) (cdr lst))))\n\n;; Tests\n(expect (pack-in-threes '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)) '((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7)))\n(expect (pack-in-threes '(1 2 3 4 5)) '((1 2 3) (4 5)))\n(expect (pack-in-threes '(1 2 3)) '((1 2 3)))\n(expect (pack-in-threes '(1 2)) '((1 2)))\n(expect (pack-in-threes '()) '())\n```\n\nIn this implementation, `take` and `drop` are auxiliary functions used to extract the first three elements from `t` and skip the first three elements of `t`, respectively. The recursion continues until the entire list `t` is processed."
Revise the problem to emphasize the usage of linked lists and require an efficient solution:\n\nImplement `intersection_count`, which takes two linked lists (without repetitions within each list) of strings `list1` and `list2`, sorted in alphabetical order. Return the count of how many strings appear in both linked lists. Use the properties of linked lists to ensure an efficient solution without converting them into arrays.\n\n```python\nclass Link:\n    """A simple linked list implementation."""\n\n    empty = ()\n\n    def __init__(self, first, rest=empty):\n        assert rest is Link.empty or isinstance(rest, Link)\n        self.first = first\n        self.rest = rest\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        if self.rest is not Link.empty:\n            rest_repr = ", " + repr(self.rest)\n        else:\n            rest_repr = ""\n        return "Link(" + repr(self.first) + rest_repr + ")"\n\ndef intersection_count(list1, list2):\n    \'\'\'For sorted linked lists list1 and list2, count the strings that appear in both.\n\n    >>> list1 = Link(\'apple\', Link(\'banana\', Link(\'cherry\', Link(\'date\', Link(\'fig\')))))\n    >>> list2 = Link(\'banana\', Link(\'coconut\', Link(\'date\', Link(\'fig\', Link(\'grape\')))))\n    >>> intersection_count(list1, list2)  # banana, date, fig\n    3\n    >>> intersection_count(list1.rest, list2)  # banana, date, fig\n    3\n    >>> intersection_count(list1, list2.rest.rest)\n    2\n    \'\'\'\n\n    count = 0\n    while list1 is not Link.empty and list2 is not Link.empty:\n        if list1.first == list2.first:\n            count += 1\n            list1 = list1.rest\n            list2 = list2.rest\n        elif list1.first < list2.first:\n            list1 = list1.rest\n        else:\n            list2 = list2.rest\n    return count\n```\n\nEnsure you test your solution with appropriate linked list inputs as shown in the examples. This problem now tests the understanding of linked list operations and exploits their sorted nature to efficiently solve the problem.'
Implement the function `common_elements`, which takes two linked lists of strings, `u` and `v`, that are sorted in lexicographical order and have no duplicate strings within each list. The function should return the count of how many strings appear in both lists. Aim for a solution that runs in linear time with respect to the combined length of the two lists.\n\n```python\nclass Link:\n    """A linked list with a head node and an optional tail node."""\n    def __init__(self, first, rest=None):\n        self.first = first\n        self.rest = rest\n\ndef common_elements(u, v):\n    \'\'\'For lexicographically ordered u and v, count the strings that appear in both.\n\n    >>> a = Link(\'apple\', Link(\'banana\', Link(\'cherry\', Link(\'date\', Link(\'fig\')))))\n    >>> b = Link(\'apricot\', Link(\'banana\', Link(\'date\', Link(\'elderberry\', Link(\'fig\')))))\n    >>> common_elements(a, b)  # banana, date, and fig\n    3\n    >>> common_elements(a.rest, b)  # banana and date\n    2\n    >>> common_elements(a, b.rest)  # banana, date, and fig\n    3\n    >>> common_elements(Link(\'apple\'), Link(\'\'))  # should handle empty string case\n    0\n    >>> common_elements(Link(\'apple\'), None)  # should handle None case\n    0\n    \'\'\'\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while u is not None and v is not None:\n        if u.first == v.first:\n            count += 1\n            u = u.rest\n            v = v.rest\n        elif u.first < v.first:\n            u = u.rest\n        else:\n            v = v.rest\n\n    return count\n```'
Implement `cumulative_sum`, a generator function that takes `s`, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the cumulative sum of the values from `s`. If `s` iterates over a positive finite number of values `n`, then `cumulative_sum` should yield `n` times.\n\n```python\ndef cumulative_sum(s):\n    '''Yield the cumulative sum of values from iterator s.\n\n    >>> list(cumulative_sum(iter([1, 2, 3, 4])))\n    [1, 3, 6, 10]\n    >>> next(cumulative_sum(iter([10, 20, 30])))\n    10\n    '''\n    total = 0\n    for value in s:\n        total += value\n        yield total\n```\n\nThis function uses a loop to iterate over the input iterator `s`, maintaining a running total of the cumulative sum and yielding each intermediate sum."
